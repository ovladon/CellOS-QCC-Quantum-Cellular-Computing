Media Player Example
This example demonstrates a multimedia player implemented using the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) architecture. It showcases how specialized cells can assemble dynamically to create a full-featured media playback application.
Overview
The Media Player example illustrates how QCC can handle multimedia content by dynamically assembling cells with various media-related capabilities. This application demonstrates:

Media file decoding and playback
Dynamic user interface generation
Streaming content handling
Cross-cell coordination for media operations
Adaptive resource allocation for optimal performance

Features

Audio and video playback support
Multiple format compatibility (MP3, MP4, WAV, FLAC, etc.)
Streaming support for online content
Playback controls (play, pause, stop, seek)
Playlist management
Volume and playback speed control
Media metadata display
Responsive UI that adapts to available screen space

Architecture
The Media Player is assembled from these specialized cells:

Cell Type          Capability          Description

media_player_ui    user_interface      Provides the player UI components
audio_processor    audio_playback      Handles audio decoding and playback
video_processor    video_playback      Handles video decoding and rendering
media_controller   playback_control    Manages playback operations
playlist_manager   content_management  Manages playlists and media library
streaming_service  media_streaming     Handles streaming from remote sources
metadata_extractor metadata_processing Extracts and displays media metadata

Cell Communication Flow
The Media Player example demonstrates complex cell communication patterns:

+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
| media_player_ui  | <---> | media_controller | <---> | playlist_manager |
+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
        |                         |                          |
        v                         v                          v
+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
| audio_processor  | <---> | video_processor  | <---> | streaming_service|
+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
        \                         /                          /
         \                       /                          /
          \                     /                          /
           v                   v                          v
               +------------------+
               | metadata_extractor|
               +------------------+
               
Running the Example
To run this example:

Set up the QCC development environment:
pip install qcc-cli

Start the local QCC environment:
qcc dev start

Run the Media Player example:
cd examples/media-player
python player.py

Code Walkthrough
Player Implementation (player.py)
The main script uses the QCC client to request a solution with media playback capabilities and sets up the user interface. It handles user interactions and coordinates cell activities for media playback.
Solution Blueprint
The example includes a blueprint for the assembler that describes the required cell assembly:

{
  "intents": ["play media", "audio player", "video player", "multimedia"],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "user_interface",
    "audio_playback",
    "video_playback",
    "playback_control",
    "content_management",
    "media_streaming",
    "metadata_processing"
  ],
  "connections": {
    "media_player_ui": ["media_controller", "audio_processor", "video_processor"],
    "media_controller": ["audio_processor", "video_processor", "playlist_manager", "streaming_service"],
    "playlist_manager": ["metadata_extractor", "streaming_service"],
    "audio_processor": ["metadata_extractor"],
    "video_processor": ["metadata_extractor"]
  }
}

Resource Adaptation
The Media Player demonstrates QCC's ability to adapt to available resources:

On low-memory devices, it may use streaming playback with minimal buffering
On high-performance devices, it can pre-cache content and enable additional processing features
Video quality automatically adjusts based on available bandwidth and processing power
UI complexity scales based on screen size and input methods

Quantum Trail Integration
This example showcases how the quantum trail system enhances the media player experience:

Remembers playback positions across sessions without identifying the user
Learns media preferences while maintaining privacy
Adapts buffering strategies based on usage patterns
Optimizes cell assembly based on previous successful configurations

Implementation Notes

Media decoding leverages WebAssembly cells for performance-critical operations
Custom cells can be added to support additional media formats
The player degrades gracefully when specific capabilities are unavailable
Cell composition adjusts based on content type (audio-only vs. video content)

Customizing the Example
You can extend this example in several ways:

Add support for additional media formats
Implement advanced audio processing (equalizer, effects)
Create specialized UI cells for different devices (TV, mobile, desktop)
Add media library management features

Learning Objectives
This example demonstrates several key QCC concepts:

Handling resource-intensive operations through specialized cells
Dynamic cell composition based on media content type
Managing complex inter-cell coordination for time-sensitive operations
Adapting to device capabilities for optimal performance

Next Steps
After exploring this example, consider:

Adding subtitle and caption support
Implementing advanced playlist features
Creating a custom cell for media conversion
Exploring integration with external media services
