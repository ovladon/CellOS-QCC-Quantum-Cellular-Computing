File Manager Example
This example demonstrates a file management application implemented using the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) architecture. It showcases how the QCC paradigm can be applied to create a flexible and secure file system interface.
Overview
The File Manager example illustrates how QCC's dynamic cell assembly creates a responsive and feature-rich file management application. It demonstrates:

Advanced file system operations
Secure permission management
Dynamic UI rendering based on file types
Storage monitoring and metrics
Content preview generation
Cross-cell data exchange

Features

Directory navigation and browsing
File operations (create, read, update, delete)
File copying, moving, and renaming
Multi-file selection and batch operations
File metadata viewing and editing
Search functionality
File type detection and preview generation
Permission management
Storage usage visualization
Archive creation and extraction
External storage integration

Architecture
The File Manager consists of these specialized cells:

Cell Type          Capability          Description

file_manager_ui    user_interface      Provides the main UI components
file_system_core   file_operations     Handles core file system operations
permission_handler security_management Manages file permissions and access
metadata_processor file_metadata       Processes and displays file metadata
preview_generator  content_preview     Generates previews for various file types
search_provider    file_search         Handles file search functionality
storage_monitor    resource_monitoring Tracks storage usage and availability
archive_handler    archive_management  Handles archive files (zip, tar, etc.)

Cell Interaction Diagram
The File Manager exemplifies complex cell interactions:

+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
| file_manager_ui  | <---> | file_system_core | <---> | permission_handler |
+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
        |                         |                          |

+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
        |                         |                          |
        v                         v                          v
+------------------+       +------------------+
| storage_monitor  | <---> | archive_handler  |
+------------------+       +------------------+

Running the Example
To run this example:

Ensure you have the QCC development environment set up:
pip install qcc-cli

Start the local QCC environment:
qcc dev start

Run the File Manager example:
cd examples/file-manager
python manager.py

Code Walkthrough
File Manager Implementation (manager.py)
The main script initializes the QCC client and requests a solution with file management capabilities. It handles user interactions and coordinates between the various cells to provide a seamless file management experience.
Solution Blueprint
The example uses this blueprint to guide the assembler in creating the appropriate cell configuration:

{
  "intents": ["manage files", "file explorer", "file management"],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "user_interface",
    "file_operations",
    "security_management",
    "file_metadata",
    "content_preview",
    "file_search",
    "resource_monitoring",
    "archive_management"
  ],
  "connections": {
    "file_manager_ui": ["file_system_core", "metadata_processor", "preview_generator", "search_provider"],
    "file_system_core": ["permission_handler", "metadata_processor", "storage_monitor", "archive_handler"],
    "permission_handler": ["metadata_processor"],
    "metadata_processor": ["preview_generator"],
    "preview_generator": ["file_system_core"],
    "search_provider": ["file_system_core", "metadata_processor"],
    "storage_monitor": ["file_system_core"],
    "archive_handler": ["file_system_core", "permission_handler"]
  }
}

Security Features
The File Manager example demonstrates QCC's security advantages:

File access permissions are strictly enforced through the permission_handler cell
Each operation occurs in isolated cell environments
Temporary elevated permissions are granted only for specific operations
Encryption and decryption occur within secure cells
Zero-knowledge file previews protect sensitive content

Progressive Enhancement
This example showcases QCC's ability to adapt to available capabilities:

Basic file operations work even with minimal cells
Preview generation adapts based on available preview cells
Search complexity scales with available search capabilities
UI richness adjusts to available rendering capabilities

Implementation Notes

The file_system_core cell interfaces with the native file system while enforcing security constraints
Metadata extraction uses specialized cells for different file types
A quantum trail records successful file operations without identifying users
Cell composition adjusts based on file types being managed

Customizing the Example
You can extend this example in several ways:

Add support for cloud storage providers
Implement version control integration
Create specialized viewer cells for different file types
Add file sharing and collaboration features
Implement advanced search capabilities

Learning Objectives
This example demonstrates several advanced QCC concepts:

Secure resource access through capability-based security
Complex cell coordination for data-intensive operations
Adapting functionality based on available cells
Managing persistent state across cell boundaries

Next Steps
After exploring this example, consider:

Adding network file sharing capabilities
Implementing file synchronization features
Creating custom viewer cells for specialized file formats
Exploring integration with version control systems
