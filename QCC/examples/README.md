QCC Examples
This directory contains example applications and use cases that demonstrate the capabilities of the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) architecture. These examples show how different cells can be assembled to create functional applications.
Overview
The examples in this directory showcase different aspects of QCC:

How cells with different capabilities can work together
Dynamic assembly of cells based on user intent
Patterns for implementing common application types
Best practices for cell communication and coordination

Each example is designed to be educational and demonstrate key concepts of the QCC architecture.

Running the Examples
To run these examples, you need a functioning QCC development environment. Follow these steps:

Ensure you have the QCC CLI installed:
pip install qcc-cli

Start the local development environment:
qcc dev start

Navigate to the example directory:
cd examples/simple-editor

Run the example:
python main.py

Creating Your Own Examples
You can use these examples as a starting point for your own applications. Here's a general approach:

Identify the capabilities your application needs
Create a solution blueprint that defines cell connections
Implement any custom cells your application requires
Write a main script that uses the QCC client to assemble cells into a solution

Example Structure
Each example follows this general structure:
example-name/
├── README.md         # Example documentation
├── main.py           # Main application entry point
├── blueprint.json    # Solution blueprint (optional)
├── cells/            # Custom cells for this example (if any)
│   └── custom_cell/
│       ├── main.py
│       └── manifest.json
└── assets/           # Example assets (if any)

Best Practices
When working with these examples, keep in mind these best practices:

Intent-Based Design: Focus on what the user wants to accomplish, not how
Capability Composition: Think in terms of capabilities rather than specific implementations
Minimal Dependencies: Avoid hard dependencies between cells
Clear Interfaces: Define clean, well-documented interfaces between cells
Resource Awareness: Be mindful of resource usage in your cell implementations
