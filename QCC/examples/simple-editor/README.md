Simple Editor Example
This example demonstrates a basic text editor implementation using the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) architecture. It shows how different cells can dynamically assemble to provide text editing functionality.
Overview
The Simple Editor is a minimalist text editor that showcases:

Dynamic assembly of text processing cells
User interface generation and interaction
File system integration for saving and loading files
State management across cell boundaries

This example demonstrates how QCC's cellular architecture enables the creation of a functional application with minimal permanent components.
Features

Basic text editing (insert, delete, select)
File operations (new, open, save, save as)
Basic formatting (bold, italic, underline)
Search and replace functionality
Undo/redo support
Persistent preferences

Architecture
The Simple Editor is assembled from the following cells:

Cell Type      Capability       Description

text_editor_ui user_interface   Provides the editor UI components
text_processor text_processing  Handles text manipulation and formatting
file_system    file_operations  Manages file operations
search_engine  text_search      Provides search and replace functionality
preferences    state_management Stores user preferences

These cells are dynamically assembled by the QCC Assembler when the user expresses an intent to edit text.
Cell Communication

The diagram below shows the communication flow between cells:
+----------------+       +------------------+
| text_editor_ui | <---> | text_processor   |
+----------------+       +------------------+
        |                         |
        v                         v
+----------------+       +------------------+
| file_system    | <---> | search_engine    |
+----------------+       +------------------+
                \         /
                 v       v
            +------------------+
            | preferences      |
            +------------------+
            
Running the Example
To run this example:

Ensure you have the QCC development environment set up:
pip install qcc-cli

Start the local QCC environment:
qcc dev start

Run the Simple Editor example:
python main.py

Code Walkthrough
Main Application (main.py)
The main script initializes the QCC client and requests a solution with text editing capabilities. It then interacts with the assembled cells to provide the editor functionality.
Solution Blueprint
The example includes a blueprint that describes the cell assembly:

{
  "intents": ["edit text", "create document", "text editor"],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "user_interface", 
    "text_processing", 
    "file_operations", 
    "text_search", 
    "state_management"
  ],
  "connections": {
    "text_editor_ui": ["text_processor", "file_system"],
    "text_processor": ["search_engine", "preferences"],
    "file_system": ["preferences"],
    "search_engine": ["preferences"]
  }
}

Customizing the Example
You can modify this example to explore different aspects of QCC:

Add new capabilities (e.g., spell checking, grammar analysis)
Implement different user interfaces (e.g., terminal-based, web-based)
Extend file operations to support additional formats
Explore different cell communication patterns

Implementation Notes

The editor UI is rendered using a combination of HTML and CSS when running in a browser environment, and falls back to a terminal interface when in a console environment.
Cell state is maintained across solution sessions using the quantum trail system.
The example handles both online and offline operation by caching necessary cells.
Resource usage is optimized through selective activation of cells based on current user activity.

Learning Objectives
Through this example, you'll learn:

How to design applications as compositions of capabilities rather than monolithic structures
Patterns for inter-cell communication and state sharing
Techniques for progressive enhancement based on available cells
Approaches for handling varying execution environments

Next Steps
After exploring this example, consider:

Modifying the editor to support additional formats
Adding more advanced formatting capabilities
Creating custom cells to extend functionality
Exploring the quantum trail system for personalization
