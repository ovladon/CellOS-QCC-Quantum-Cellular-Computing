# Cell Repository Management

## Overview

The Repository Management module is responsible for the storage, indexing, and querying of cell libraries within the QCC Provider system. It maintains an organized collection of cells that can be efficiently retrieved based on capability requirements, version constraints, and other metadata.

## Key Components

### Storage (`./storage.py`)

Handles the physical storage of cell packages and their associated artifacts:
- Multiple storage backends (filesystem, object storage, distributed)
- Secure storage with encryption
- Access control mechanisms
- Backup and recovery
- Storage optimization and deduplication

### Indexing (`./indexing.py`)

Provides fast lookup of cells based on various attributes:
- Capability-based indexing
- Multi-dimensional search
- Vector-based similarity search
- Full-text search for cell documentation
- Performance optimization for common query patterns

### Versioning (`./versioning.py`)

Manages cell versions and dependencies:
- Semantic versioning support
- Version conflict resolution
- Dependency tracking and resolution
- Update management
- Compatibility checks
- Rollback capabilities

### Metadata (`./metadata.py`)

Tracks and manages cell metadata:
- Capability specifications
- Resource requirements
- Authorship and provenance
- Usage statistics
- Security information
- Compatibility information

## Usage

```python
from qcc.providers.repository import CellRepository

# Initialize repository
repository = CellRepository(
    storage_type="distributed",
    index_strategy="capability",
    enable_versioning=True
)

# Store a cell
cell_id = repository.store_cell(cell_data, metadata)

# Retrieve cells by capability
cells = repository.find_cells_by_capability(
    capabilities=["text_processing", "sentiment_analysis"],
    version_constraint=">=1.0.0",
    limit=5
)

# Get cell by ID and version
cell = repository.get_cell(cell_id, version="1.2.3")

# Update a cell
repository.update_cell(cell_id, new_cell_data, new_metadata)

# Remove a cell
repository.remove_cell(cell_id, version="1.2.3")

Configuration
The repository module can be configured through the repository_config.yaml file:
storage:
  type: "distributed"  # Options: local, s3, distributed
  path: "/path/to/storage"
  encryption: true
  compression: true

indexing:
  strategy: "hybrid"  # Options: simple, capability, vector, hybrid
  search_backend: "elasticsearch"
  cache_size_mb: 512
  update_strategy: "immediate"

versioning:
  strategy: "semantic"
  conflict_resolution: "auto"
  max_versions_per_cell: 10
  prune_policy: "keep_major"

metadata:
  schema_validation: true
  required_fields:
    - "capabilities"
    - "resource_requirements"
    - "security_info"
  extended_stats: true

Architecture
The Repository module uses a layered architecture:

API Layer: Provides a clean interface for other components
Logic Layer: Implements the core repository functionality
Storage Layer: Abstracts the physical storage mechanisms
Index Layer: Manages the indexing and search functionality

Security Considerations

All stored cells are cryptographically signed
Access control is enforced at the repository level
Metadata is validated against schemas to prevent injection attacks
Version updates are verified before acceptance
All actions are logged for audit purposes
