# Quantum Trail System

The Quantum Trail system is a core component of Quantum Cellular Computing, providing secure, anonymous user identification and personalization without compromising privacy.

## Core Concept

A Quantum Trail is a unique digital signature derived from quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms that:

1. Provides unforgeable uniqueness for users and sessions
2. Enables personalization without identification
3. Records usage patterns in a privacy-preserving manner
4. Ensures non-repeatability of system states

## Implementation Details

The Quantum Trail system consists of three main components:

### 1. Signature Generation

Located in the `signature/` directory, this component:
- Creates unique quantum-resistant signatures for users and sessions
- Ensures signatures cannot be linked to personal identities
- Provides temporal uniqueness for each system interaction

### 2. Blockchain Integration

Located in the `blockchain/` directory, this component:
- Records usage patterns in a distributed ledger
- Ensures non-repudiation of signatures
- Provides immutable history of system interactions
- Enables secure verification without centralized authority

### 3. Privacy Mechanisms

Located in the `privacy/` directory, this component:
- Ensures personal data remains protected
- Implements zero-knowledge proofs for verification
- Provides differential privacy for aggregated data
- Supports data minimization principles

## Usage in QCC

The Quantum Trail system is used throughout the QCC architecture:

1. **User Recognition**: The assembler recognizes returning users without identifying them
2. **Cell Authentication**: Cells verify they are being used in authorized contexts
3. **Configuration Memory**: The system "remembers" successful configurations
4. **Security Verification**: Ensures the integrity of the overall system

## Technical Requirements

The current implementation uses:

1. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and CRYSTALS-Dilithium for signatures
2. **Distributed Ledger**: A lightweight blockchain implementation for distributed verification
3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: For privacy-preserving verification of properties

## Getting Started

To use the Quantum Trail system in your implementation:

```python
from qcc.quantum_trail import QuantumTrailManager

# Initialize the manager
trail_manager = QuantumTrailManager()

# Generate a signature for a user session
signature = await trail_manager.generate_signature(
    user_id="anonymous",
    context={"device_type": "laptop", "session_start": "2025-03-25T10:15:30Z"},
    entropy_source="hardware"  # Options: hardware, system, hybrid
)

# Verify a signature
is_valid = await trail_manager.verify_signature(signature)

# Record an assembly in the blockchain
transaction_id = await trail_manager.record_assembly(
    quantum_signature=signature,
    cell_configuration=["cell_id_1", "cell_id_2", "cell_id_3"],
    performance_metrics={"response_time_ms": 120, "memory_usage_mb": 45}
)

# Find similar configurations
similar_configs = await trail_manager.find_similar_configurations(
    capabilities=["text_editing", "spell_checking"],
    performance_threshold=0.8
)
