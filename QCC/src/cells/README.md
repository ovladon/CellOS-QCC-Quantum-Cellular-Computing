# QCC Cell Development Guidelines

## Introduction

This directory contains cell implementations for the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) system. Cells are the fundamental units of computation in QCC, each providing specific capabilities that can be dynamically assembled to fulfill user needs.

## Cell Categories

QCC cells are organized into three main categories:

1. **System Cells**: Core cells that provide fundamental system functionality like file system access, process management, and device control.
2. **Middleware Cells**: Intermediary cells that provide cross-cutting services like data transformation, security, communication, and integration.
3. **Application Cells**: End-user focused cells that implement specific application functionality like text editors, media players, and calculation tools.

## Cell Structure

Each cell implementation should follow this general structure:
my_cell/
├── main.py                 # Core cell implementation
├── manifest.json           # Cell metadata
├── requirements.txt        # Dependencies
├── tests/                  # Test directory
│   └── test_cell.py        # Unit tests
└── README.md               # Documentation

### manifest.json

The manifest file describes the cell's capabilities, parameters, and resource requirements:

```json
{
  "name": "my_cell",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Description of the cell's purpose",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "capability_name",
      "description": "Description of the capability",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "param_name",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Parameter description",
          "required": true
        }
      ],
      "outputs": [
        {
          "name": "output_name",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Output description"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": [],
  "resource_requirements": {
    "memory_mb": 100,
    "cpu_percent": 10
  }
}

main.py
The core implementation should inherit from BaseCell and implement the cell's capabilities:
from qcc.cells import BaseCell
from typing import Dict, Any

class MyCell(BaseCell):
    """A cell that provides some capability."""
    
    def initialize(self, parameters):
        """Initialize the cell with parameters."""
        super().initialize(parameters)
        
        # Register capabilities
        self.register_capability("capability_name", self.my_capability)
        
        # Log initialization
        self.logger.info(f"Cell initialized with ID: {self.cell_id}")
        
        return self.get_initialization_result()
    
    async def my_capability(self, parameters: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Implementation of the capability."""
        # Capability implementation goes here
        
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "outputs": [
                {
                    "name": "result",
                    "value": "Capability result",
                    "type": "string"
                }
            ],
            "performance_metrics": {
                "execution_time_ms": 10,
                "memory_used_mb": 5
            }
        }
        
Best Practices
Security

Validate Input: Always validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
Minimize Dependencies: Use only necessary dependencies to reduce the attack surface.
Sandbox Operations: Limit operations to what's strictly needed for the cell's functionality.
Handle Errors Gracefully: Never expose sensitive information in error messages.
Respect Resource Limits: Adhere to memory and CPU limits to prevent resource exhaustion.

Performance

Minimize Initialization Time: Keep cell initialization as fast as possible.
Use Efficient Data Structures: Choose appropriate data structures for your operations.
Batch Operations: Where possible, batch similar operations together.
Implement Caching: Cache results of expensive computations.
Profile Your Code: Use profiling tools to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

Maintainability

Comprehensive Documentation: Document your cell's capabilities thoroughly.
Clean Code Structure: Follow good software engineering practices.
Consistent Error Handling: Implement consistent error handling patterns.
Extensive Testing: Create comprehensive test suites for your cells.
Version Management: Use semantic versioning and maintain a changelog.

Cell Composition

Clear Interfaces: Define clear, consistent interfaces for your cell's capabilities.
Minimal Dependencies: Minimize hard dependencies on specific implementations.
Graceful Degradation: Design cells to function with reduced capabilities when ideal dependencies aren't available.
Standardized Data Formats: Use standardized formats for data exchange.
Event-Based Communication: Leverage event-based patterns for loose coupling.

Testing
Each cell should include comprehensive tests in the tests/ directory:
import pytest
import asyncio
from my_cell.main import MyCell

@pytest.fixture
def cell():
    """Create a cell for testing."""
    cell = MyCell()
    cell.initialize({
        "cell_id": "test-cell",
        "quantum_signature": "test-signature"
    })
    return cell

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_capability(cell):
    """Test the cell's capability."""
    result = await cell.my_capability({
        "param_name": "test_value"
    })
    
    assert result["status"] == "success"
    assert result["outputs"][0]["name"] == "result"
    assert result["outputs"][0]["value"] == "Expected result"
    
Building and Registering Cells
Use the QCC CLI to build and register your cells:
# Build the cell
qcc cell build --name my_cell

# Register with a provider
qcc cell register --name my_cell --provider your_provider

WebAssembly Cells
For performance-critical cells, consider using WebAssembly:

Implement the cell in a language that compiles to Wasm (e.g., Rust, C++, AssemblyScript)
Compile to Wasm with the wasm32-wasi target
Create a manifest file with "wasm": true and "wasm_entrypoint": "my_cell.wasm"

See the WebAssembly cell examples in the system/ directory for details.
Examples
Each category directory contains example cells:

system/: System-level cell implementations
middleware/: Middleware cell implementations
application/: Application-level cell implementations

Study these examples to understand the patterns and best practices for each cell category.
