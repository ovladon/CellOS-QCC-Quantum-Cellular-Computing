# QCC Assembler

The Assembler is the core orchestration component of the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) system. It interprets user intent, requests appropriate cells from providers, manages cell lifecycle, and coordinates cell interactions.

## Core Components

The Assembler consists of several key components:

### 1. Core
The core module provides the central CellAssembler class and related functionality for managing the assembly process.

### 2. Intent
The intent module handles the interpretation of user requests into specific requirements and capabilities, using natural language understanding and contextual analysis.

### 3. Security
The security module manages authentication, cell verification, and secure communication between components.

### 4. Runtime
The runtime module handles the execution environment for cells, managing their lifecycle and interactions.

## API

The Assembler exposes a RESTful API that allows applications to:
- Submit user intents
- Manage active solutions
- Query system status
- Configure assembler behavior

See the API documentation for details on available endpoints and parameters.

## Configuration

The Assembler can be configured through the `config.yaml` file, which allows customization of:
- Provider connections
- Security settings
- Performance optimizations
- Resource allocation strategies

## Development

To set up a development environment for the Assembler:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure local providers: Edit `config.yaml`
3. Start the development server: `python -m qcc.assembler.serve --dev`

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
pytest tests/assembler/
