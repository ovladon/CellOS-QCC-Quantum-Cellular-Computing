# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Prioritizing privacy and security in all contributions and interactions
* Supporting the evolution of the QCC ecosystem within the constraints of human safety and welfare

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Introducing code that compromises the privacy, security, or integrity of the QCC system
* Attempting to circumvent the security or privacy mechanisms of the system
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including the GitHub repository, community forums, Discord server, mailing lists, and any other official QCC spaces, as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team responsible for enforcement at [conduct@cellcomputing.ai]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html).

## QCC-Specific Considerations

Given the unique nature of the QCC project, we emphasize these additional considerations:

### Privacy and Security

All contributors must prioritize user privacy and security in their contributions. This includes:
- Ensuring all code adheres to the privacy-by-design principles of QCC
- Never circumventing or weakening the quantum trail system's anonymization features
- Following the security best practices outlined in the QCC documentation
- Promptly reporting any security vulnerabilities through proper channels

### Cell Evolution Ethics

Contributors working on cell evolution mechanisms must adhere to the human-centric safety constraints:
- All evolutionary changes must pass safety verification
- Evolution must be evaluated against metrics for human benefit
- Evolved behaviors must be explainable to humans
- Reversion mechanisms must be maintained

### Interoperability and Inclusion

The QCC project values universal interoperability. Contributors should:
- Design cells and components that work across diverse hardware
- Ensure accessibility for users with different abilities
- Document interfaces clearly to enable broad participation
- Consider resource constraints to enable usage on a wide range of devices
