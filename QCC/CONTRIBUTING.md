Code of Conduct
By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please read it before contributing.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
WebAssembly toolchain (for cell development)
Git

Setting Up Your Development Environment
1.Fork the repository on GitHub
2.Clone your fork locally: 
git clone https://github.com/ovladon/QCC
3.Set up a virtual environment: 
python -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
4.Install development dependencies: 
pip install -e ".[dev]"
5.Set up pre-commit hooks: 
pre-commit install

How to Contribute
There are many ways to contribute to QCC:
1. Develop Cells
Create new cells or improve existing ones. See the Cell Development Guide for detailed instructions.
2. Enhance the Assembler
Work on improving the core assembler functionality, including intent interpretation, security features, or runtime performance.
3. Extend the Quantum Trail System
Contribute to the blockchain-based quantum trail implementation, improving privacy or performance aspects.
4. Improve Documentation
Help make our documentation clearer, more comprehensive, or more accessible.
5. Report Bugs
Found an issue? Report it using the GitHub issue tracker, providing as much detail as possible.
6. Suggest Features
Have an idea for improving QCC? Open an issue with the "enhancement" tag and describe your proposal.
7. Help with Testing
Expand our test coverage or improve existing tests.

Development Workflow
1.Select an Issue: Start by finding an open issue that interests you, or create a new one to discuss your proposed changes.
2.Discuss: For significant changes, start a discussion in the issue to align on the approach before coding.
3.Branch: Create a branch for your work with a descriptive name:
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
or
git checkout -b fix/issue-you-are-fixing
4.Develop: Make your changes, following our Coding Standards.
5.Test: Ensure your changes pass all tests:
pytest
6.Document: Update documentation as needed to reflect your changes.
7.Commit: Make atomic commits with clear messages following our commit message conventions.
8.Submit: Push your branch and create a pull request.

Pull Request Process
1.Ensure your PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number.
2.Make sure all CI checks pass.
3.Update documentation if needed.
4.Your PR needs approval from at least one maintainer before merging.
5.Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

Commit Message Conventions
We follow Conventional Commits:
feat: for new features
fix: for bug fixes
docs: for documentation changes
style: for formatting changes that don't affect code functionality
refactor: for code refactoring
test: for adding or modifying tests
chore: for maintenance tasks
Example: feat(assembler): add support for dynamic cell loading

Coding Standards
Python Code
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
Use type hints
Document functions and classes using docstrings (Google style)
Aim for 90% test coverage for new code
WebAssembly/Cell Code
Follow the Cell Interface Specification
Include comprehensive metadata
Ensure cells are properly sandboxed
Testing Guidelines
Write unit tests for all new functionality
Include integration tests for cell interactions
Add performance benchmarks for performance-critical code
Tests should be in the tests/ directory matching the structure of the source code
Example test structure:
tests/
  assembler/
    test_intent.py
    test_security.py
    ...
  cells/
    test_file_system.py
    ...

Documentation
Good documentation is crucial for the QCC project:
Update relevant documentation when changing code
Documentation should be clear, concise, and accessible
Use Markdown for documentation files
Include code examples where appropriate
For architecture changes, update diagrams in the docs/architecture/ directory

Community
