Security Policy

Introduction
Security is a foundational principle of the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) project. As a system designed to minimize the permanent attack surface while providing dynamic computing capabilities, security is inherent to our architecture.
This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities, our security assessment process, and best practices for maintaining security in QCC implementations.

Reporting a Vulnerability
We take all security issues seriously. Thank you for helping improve the security of the QCC project.
Reporting Process
1. Do NOT disclose security vulnerabilities publicly (including in the public issue tracker)
2. Send vulnerability reports to security@cellos.tech
3. Include the following information in your report:
1.Description of the vulnerability
2.Steps to reproduce the issue
3.Potential impact
4.Any suggested fixes or mitigations (if available)
4. PGP Key: Our security team's PGP key is available at https://cellos.tech/security-key.asc
5. What to Expect After Reporting
1.Initial Response: You'll receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours.
2.Assessment: Our security team will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity and impact.
3.Updates: We'll provide updates on the progress of addressing the vulnerability.
4.Resolution: Once fixed, we'll notify you and discuss disclosure timing.
5.Recognition: With your permission, we'll credit you in our security advisory.

Scope
This security policy applies to:
Core QCC codebase (assembler, quantum trail system, provider interfaces)
Reference cell implementations
Documentation and examples
Development tools

Security Assessment Process
For each release, we conduct a comprehensive security review that includes:
1.Static Analysis: Automated code scanning using multiple tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2.Dynamic Analysis: Runtime testing with fuzzing and other dynamic analysis techniques.
3.Dependency Scanning: Verification of all dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
4.Cryptographic Review: Specific focus on our quantum-resistant cryptographic implementations.
5.External Audits: Regular security audits by independent security experts.

Security Model
The QCC security model is built on several core principles:
1. Minimal Permanent Attack Surface
The assembler is the only permanently installed component, significantly reducing the persistent attack surface compared to traditional operating systems.
2. Ephemeral Execution Environments
Cells exist only for the duration of their need, limiting the window of opportunity for attacks.
3. Post-Quantum Cryptography
All security-critical operations use quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms to protect against future quantum computing threats.
4. Cell Verification
All cells undergo verification before execution to ensure they meet security standards and haven't been tampered with.
5. Sandboxing
Cells operate in isolated environments with restricted access to system resources.
6. Least Privilege
Each cell operates with the minimum privileges required for its function.

Best Practices for QCC Security
For Core Developers
1.Follow the Secure Development Guidelines
2.Always use the provided security APIs for cryptographic operations
3.Never bypass the cell verification process
4.Conduct thorough security testing for all changes
For Cell Developers
1.Follow the Cell Security Guidelines
2.Declare all resource requirements explicitly
3.Minimize the attack surface of your cell
4.Keep dependencies updated and secure
For Implementers
1.Keep the assembler updated with security patches
2.Use trusted cell providers
3.Implement network-level protections for provider communications
4.Follow the Deployment Security Checklist

Security Updates and Patches
Security updates are provided through our standard release channels, with the following considerations:
1.Critical Vulnerabilities: Patches are released as soon as possible, outside the normal release cycle if necessary.
2.Notification: Security advisories are published for all significant vulnerabilities at https://cellos.tech/security-advisories.
3.Backporting: Security fixes are backported to supported versions when applicable.
4.LTS Versions: Long-term support versions receive security updates for an extended period.
5.Supported Versions
Version	Supported	Security Support Until
0.3.x	:white_check_mark:	Current development
0.2.x	:white_check_mark:	2025-09-30
0.1.x	:x:	2025-03-31 (Ended)

Bug Bounty Program
We maintain a bug bounty program to encourage the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Details can be found at https://cellos.tech/bug-bounty.
Security Research
We welcome and encourage security research on the QCC project. If you're conducting security research, please:
1.Stay within the scope defined in our Bug Bounty Program
2.Avoid accessing or modifying user data
3.Avoid disrupting normal system operations
4.Report vulnerabilities through our responsible disclosure process

Acknowledgments
We'd like to thank the following individuals and organizations for their contributions to the security of the QCC project:
Members of our security team
External security researchers who have responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities
The open-source security community for their tools and guidance
