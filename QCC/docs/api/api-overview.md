# QCC API Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the API specifications for the Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) system. These APIs define the standard interfaces for interactions between the core components of the QCC architecture: the assembler, cells, provider services, and the quantum trail system.

## API Design Principles

The QCC APIs are designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Consistency**: All APIs follow a consistent design pattern, making them intuitive to use across the system.

2. **Minimalism**: APIs expose only essential functionality, reducing the attack surface and improving maintainability.

3. **Extensibility**: APIs are designed to evolve without breaking backward compatibility.

4. **Security First**: Security considerations are built into the API design rather than added as an afterthought.

5. **Performance Efficiency**: APIs are optimized for low latency and minimal resource consumption.

6. **Language Agnosticism**: APIs are defined in a language-neutral way, allowing implementation in various programming languages.

7. **Documentation Completeness**: All APIs are thoroughly documented, including examples and edge cases.

## API Categories

The QCC APIs are organized into several categories based on their functionality and the components they connect:

### 1. Assembler APIs

APIs exposed by the assembler for user interaction and system management:

- **User Intent API**: Allows applications to submit user intent for interpretation and fulfillment.
- **Solution Management API**: Provides methods to manage active solutions (query, pause, resume, release).
- **System Status API**: Offers information about the system's current state and performance.
- **Configuration API**: Enables customization of assembler behavior and preferences.

### 2. Cell Request APIs

APIs for interactions between the assembler and cell providers:

- **Capability Request API**: Used by the assembler to request cells based on capabilities.
- **Cell Delivery API**: Used by providers to deliver requested cells to the assembler.
- **Cell Authentication API**: Handles verification of cell authenticity and integrity.
- **Provider Discovery API**: Enables discovery of available cell providers.

### 3. Inter-Cell Communication APIs

APIs that define how cells communicate with each other:

- **Message Passing API**: Standardized methods for cells to exchange messages.
- **Event Notification API**: Allows cells to subscribe to and publish events.
- **Resource Sharing API**: Protocols for cells to share access to resources.
- **Stream Processing API**: Specialized interfaces for continuous data processing.

### 4. Quantum Trail APIs

APIs for interactions with the quantum trail system:

- **Signature Generation API**: Creates quantum-resistant signatures for cell assemblies.
- **Trail Recording API**: Records solution configurations and performance metrics.
- **Pattern Query API**: Searches for patterns in past assemblies.
- **Blockchain Integration API**: Interfaces with the underlying blockchain.

### 5. Provider Service APIs

APIs for cell providers to manage their cell repositories:

- **Cell Registration API**: Registers new cells with the provider service.
- **Cell Update API**: Updates existing cells with new versions or patches.
- **Usage Analytics API**: Collects anonymized data about cell usage patterns.
- **Provider Federation API**: Enables collaboration between different providers.

## API Versioning

QCC uses a semantic versioning approach for all APIs:

- **Major Versions (X.y.z)**: Incompatible API changes that require client modifications.
- **Minor Versions (x.Y.z)**: Functionality added in a backward-compatible manner.
- **Patch Versions (x.y.Z)**: Backward-compatible bug fixes.

All APIs include version information in their requests and responses. The system supports multiple API versions simultaneously to facilitate smooth transitions.

## Authentication and Authorization

QCC APIs use a comprehensive authentication and authorization system:

- **Authentication Methods**: APIs support multiple authentication methods, including:
  - Quantum-resistant digital signatures
  - Challenge-response protocols
  - OAuth 2.0 for external integrations

- **Authorization Model**: A capability-based authorization model where:
  - Access tokens specify allowed operations
  - Permissions are fine-grained and context-specific
  - Token lifetimes are minimized
  - Revocation is possible at any time

## Data Formats

QCC APIs use standardized data formats:

- **Primary Format**: JSON for most API requests and responses
- **Binary Format**: Protocol Buffers for performance-critical or high-volume data
- **Streaming Format**: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- **Schema Definition**: OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for REST APIs

## Error Handling

QCC APIs implement consistent error handling:

- **Error Structure**: All errors include:
  - Unique error code
  - Human-readable message
  - Error category
  - Timestamp
  - Request identifier
  - Troubleshooting links

- **Error Categories**:
  - Authentication errors (401, 403)
  - Resource errors (404, 410)
  - Validation errors (400, 422)
  - Rate limiting errors (429)
  - Server errors (500, 503)
  - Cell-specific errors (600-699)

- **Internationalization**: Error messages support multiple languages.

## Rate Limiting

To protect system resources, all QCC APIs implement rate limiting:

- **Limit Types**:
  - Requests per second
  - Requests per minute
  - Data volume per day
  - Concurrent connections

- **Limit Indicators**: API responses include headers indicating:
  - Current usage
  - Remaining quota
  - Reset time

- **Handling Strategies**:
  - Exponential backoff for retries
  - Priority-based queuing
  - Graceful degradation

## Documentation Standards

All QCC APIs are documented according to these standards:

- **OpenAPI 3.0**: REST APIs are documented using OpenAPI specifications.
- **gRPC Protocol Buffers**: gRPC APIs are documented using Protocol Buffers.
- **Interactive Documentation**: All APIs have interactive documentation with try-it features.
- **Code Examples**: Documentation includes examples in multiple programming languages.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for common use cases.
- **References**: Complete reference documentation for all endpoints and operations.

## API Governance

QCC maintains API quality through a governance process:

- **Design Reviews**: All new APIs undergo peer review before implementation.
- **Security Audits**: Security experts review APIs for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Testing**: APIs are tested for performance under various loads.
- **Deprecation Policy**: Clear process for deprecating and retiring APIs.
- **Breaking Change Policy**: Strict rules about when breaking changes are allowed.
- **Feedback Cycle**: Regular collection and incorporation of developer feedback.

## API Implementation Technologies

QCC APIs are implemented using these technologies:

- **REST APIs**: HTTP/HTTPS-based APIs for general-purpose interactions.
- **gRPC**: High-performance RPC framework for internal component communication.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time, bidirectional communication.
- **GraphQL**: For flexible data querying where appropriate.
- **WebAssembly**: For cell interfaces that require high performance.
