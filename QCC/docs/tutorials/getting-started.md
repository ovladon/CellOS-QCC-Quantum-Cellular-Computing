# Getting Started with QCC

## Introduction

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC). We'll cover setting up a development environment, installing the necessary tools, and creating a simple "Hello World" example to demonstrate the core concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with QCC, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: Required for the reference implementation
- **Node.js 16+**: Used for some client-side tools and examples
- **Rust 1.55+**: Used for WebAssembly cell development
- **Docker**: For containerization and testing
- **Git**: For source code management

## Installation

### 1. Clone the QCC Repository

First, clone the QCC repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ovladon/QCC.git
cd QCC
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install the QCC CLI

The QCC Command Line Interface (CLI) provides tools for working with the QCC system:

```bash
pip install qcc-cli
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Verify your installation is working correctly:

```bash
qcc --version
```

You should see output indicating the version of the QCC CLI you've installed.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

### 1. Initialize a Project

Create a new QCC project:

```bash
mkdir my-qcc-project
cd my-qcc-project
qcc init
```

This will create a basic project structure with the following files:

```
my-qcc-project/
├── config.yaml             # Configuration file
├── cells/                  # Directory for cell implementations
├── examples/               # Example applications
├── README.md               # Project documentation
└── .gitignore              # Git ignore file
```

### 2. Configure Local Assembler

Edit the `config.yaml` file to configure your local assembler:

```yaml
assembler:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  development_mode: true
  log_level: debug

providers:
  - name: local_provider
    url: http://localhost:8081
    priority: 1
    capabilities:
      - text_generation
      - file_system
      - ui_rendering

quantum_trail:
  enabled: true
  local_blockchain: true
  sync_interval_ms: 5000
```

### 3. Start the Development Environment

Start the local development environment:

```bash
qcc dev start
```

This command starts the following components:

- Local assembler on port 8080
- Local cell provider on port 8081
- Local quantum trail system
- Development dashboard on port 8082

You can access the development dashboard at http://localhost:8082

## Creating a "Hello World" Example

Let's create a simple "Hello World" example to demonstrate the basic concepts of QCC.

### 1. Create a Basic Cell

First, let's create a simple text output cell:

```bash
qcc cell create --name hello_world --capability text_output
```

This creates a template cell in the `cells/hello_world` directory.

### 2. Implement the Cell

Edit the `cells/hello_world/main.py` file:

```python
from qcc.cells import BaseCell

class HelloWorldCell(BaseCell):
    """A simple cell that outputs 'Hello, Quantum Cellular Computing!'"""
    
    def initialize(self, parameters):
        """Initialize the cell with parameters."""
        super().initialize(parameters)
        self.register_capability("text_output", self.generate_text)
        return self.get_initialization_result()
    
    async def generate_text(self, parameters=None):
        """Generate a greeting text."""
        greeting = "Hello, Quantum Cellular Computing!"
        if parameters and "name" in parameters:
            greeting = f"Hello, {parameters['name']}! Welcome to Quantum Cellular Computing!"
        
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "outputs": [
                {
                    "name": "text",
                    "value": greeting,
                    "type": "string"
                }
            ],
            "performance_metrics": {
                "execution_time_ms": 1,
                "memory_used_mb": 0.1
            }
        }
```

### 3. Build the Cell

Build the cell for deployment:

```bash
qcc cell build --name hello_world
```

This compiles the cell and creates a deployable package in the `cells/hello_world/dist` directory.

### 4. Register the Cell with the Local Provider

Register the cell with your local provider:

```bash
qcc cell register --name hello_world --provider local_provider
```

### 5. Create a Test Script

Create a file named `test_hello_world.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from qcc.client import AssemblerClient

async def main():
    # Connect to the local assembler
    client = AssemblerClient("http://localhost:8080")
    
    # Submit a user intent
    solution = await client.assemble_solution(
        user_request="Say hello",
        context={
            "device_info": {
                "platform": "linux",
                "memory_gb": 8,
                "cpu_cores": 4,
                "gpu_available": False
            }
        }
    )
    
    print(f"Solution ID: {solution.id}")
    
    # Wait for the solution to activate
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    # Get solution details
    solution_details = await client.get_solution_details(solution.id)
    
    # Find the text output cell
    text_output_cell = None
    for cell_id, cell in solution_details.cells.items():
        if "text_output" in cell.capability:
            text_output_cell = cell
            break
    
    if text_output_cell:
        # Execute the text output capability
        result = await client.execute_cell_capability(
            solution_id=solution.id,
            cell_id=text_output_cell.id,
            capability="text_output",
            parameters={"name": "Developer"}
        )
        
        # Print the result
        for output in result.outputs:
            if output.name == "text":
                print(f"Output: {output.value}")
    
    # Release the solution
    await client.release_solution(solution.id)
    print("Solution released")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### 6. Run the Test Script

Run the test script:

```bash
python test_hello_world.py
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Solution ID: 8f7d2a3b-c9e4-4f5a-b6d7-1a2b3c4d5e6f
Output: Hello, Developer! Welcome to Quantum Cellular Computing!
Solution released
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created and tested a basic QCC cell.

## Understanding What Happened

Let's break down what happened in this example:

1. **Cell Creation**: We created a simple cell with a `text_output` capability.
2. **Registration**: We registered the cell with a local provider.
3. **Intent Submission**: The test script submitted a user intent ("Say hello").
4. **Assembly**: The assembler interpreted the intent and assembled a solution containing the hello_world cell.
5. **Execution**: We executed the cell's capability with a parameter.
6. **Output**: The cell generated a greeting message.
7. **Release**: We released the solution, freeing its resources.

This example demonstrates the basic flow of QCC:
- User intents are interpreted.
- Appropriate cells are assembled into solutions.
- Cells execute their capabilities.
- Resources are released when no longer needed.

## Next Steps

Now that you've completed this getting started guide, here are some next steps to continue your QCC journey:

1. **Explore the Examples**: Check out the example applications in the `examples/` directory.
2. **Create More Complex Cells**: Try creating cells with different capabilities.
3. **Connect Multiple Cells**: Learn how to create solutions with multiple interconnected cells.
4. **Understand the Quantum Trail**: Learn about the quantum trail system and how it enables personalization without identification.
5. **Explore WebAssembly Cells**: Try building cells with WebAssembly for better performance and security.

## Advanced Configuration

As you become more familiar with QCC, you may want to explore advanced configuration options:

### Configuring Security Levels

```yaml
security:
  level: high  # standard, high, maximum
  verification_mode: strict  # standard, strict
  allowed_providers:
    - trusted_provider_1
    - trusted_provider_2
```

### Setting Up Multiple Providers

```yaml
providers:
  - name: primary_provider
    url: https://provider1.example.com
    priority: 1
    capabilities:
      - file_system
      - text_generation
  
  - name: specialized_provider
    url: https://provider2.example.com
    priority: 2
    capabilities:
      - image_processing
      - media_playback
```

### Configuring Performance Settings

```yaml
performance:
  resource_allocation_strategy: balanced  # balanced, memory_optimized, cpu_optimized
  prefetch_enabled: true
  prefetch_threshold: 0.8  # 0-1 confidence level
  cell_cache_size_mb: 512
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

### Cell Registration Fails

If cell registration fails, check:
- The provider service is running
- The cell package is correctly built
- The configuration points to the correct provider URL

### Assembler Cannot Find Capabilities

If the assembler cannot find requested capabilities:
- Make sure cells with those capabilities are registered
- Check provider settings in the configuration
- Verify the intent interpreter is correctly understanding the request

### Performance Issues

If you encounter performance issues:
- Check resource allocation settings
- Consider using WebAssembly cells for performance-critical functions
- Enable cell caching for frequently used cells

### Security Verification Errors

If security verification fails:
- Check the security level settings
- Verify cell signatures
- Ensure providers are trusted
