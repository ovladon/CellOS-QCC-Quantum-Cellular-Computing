# QCC Security and Privacy Architecture

## Introduction

The Quantum Cellular Computing (QCC) architecture introduces a fundamentally different approach to security and privacy. By making the attack surface ephemeral and separating personalization from identification, QCC creates inherent security and privacy advantages. This document details the security and privacy architecture of the QCC system, including threat models, mitigation strategies, and implementation details.

## Security Principles

QCC's security architecture is based on several core principles:

1. **Minimized Permanent Attack Surface**: Only the assembler is permanently installed, reducing the persistent attack surface to a minimal, well-audited component.

2. **Moving Target Defense**: The dynamic assembly of cells creates a naturally shifting architecture that is difficult to target.

3. **Micro-Segmentation by Design**: Cells operate with limited scope and permissions, creating natural security boundaries.

4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls provide redundant protection.

5. **Zero Trust Architecture**: No component is inherently trusted; all components must prove their authenticity and operate with minimal permissions.

6. **Cryptographic Agility**: The system can adapt to new cryptographic algorithms as quantum computing threats evolve.

7. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy is built into the architecture rather than added as an afterthought.

## Threat Model

The QCC security architecture addresses the following threat categories:

### External Threats

1. **Malicious Cell Injection**: Attackers attempting to introduce malicious cells into the ecosystem.
2. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Interception of communication between components.
3. **Provider Impersonation**: Attackers posing as legitimate cell providers.
4. **Denial of Service**: Attempts to overwhelm the system with requests.
5. **Quantum Computing Attacks**: Future threats from quantum computing against cryptographic algorithms.

### Internal Threats

1. **Cell Boundary Violations**: Cells attempting to access resources outside their permission scope.
2. **Malicious Providers**: Cell providers that distribute compromised cells.
3. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Extracting information through timing, power, or other side channels.
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Attempts to extract sensitive data from the system.
5. **Persistent Threats**: Attempts to establish persistence within the system.

### Privacy Threats

1. **User Tracking**: Attempts to track or identify users across sessions.
2. **Behavioral Profiling**: Creating identifiable profiles based on user behavior.
3. **Data Correlation**: Combining data from multiple sources to de-anonymize users.
4. **Quantum Trail Analysis**: Attempts to extract identifiable information from quantum trails.

## Security Components

### Assembler Security Module

The Security Manager in the assembler is the central security component with several key functions:

#### Cell Verification

- **Digital Signature Verification**: Verifies that cells are signed by trusted providers.
- **Integrity Checking**: Ensures cells have not been modified since signing.
- **Source Verification**: Confirms cells come from legitimate providers.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Checks for suspicious behavior patterns in cell code.

#### Permission Management

- **Capability-Based Security**: Cells can only access resources explicitly granted to them.
- **Dynamic Permission Adjustment**: Permissions can be adjusted based on runtime behavior.
- **Permission Inheritance Rules**: How permissions propagate through cell hierarchies.
- **Least Privilege Enforcement**: Cells operate with minimal necessary permissions.

#### Secure Communication

- **Channel Encryption**: All inter-component communication is encrypted.
- **Identity Verification**: Components verify each other's identities before communication.
- **Message Integrity**: Messages include integrity checks to prevent tampering.
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of current sessions does not compromise past sessions.

#### Threat Monitoring

- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Analyzes cell behavior for anomalies during execution.
- **Resource Usage Tracking**: Monitors for unusual resource consumption patterns.
- **Communication Pattern Analysis**: Detects unusual inter-cell communication.

### Post-Quantum Cryptography Implementation

QCC implements post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to protect against quantum computing threats:

#### Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM)

- **NTRU**: Secondary KEM algorithm for redundancy.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Classical and post-quantum algorithms used together during transition period.

#### Digital Signatures

- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**: Primary signature algorithm.
- **SPHINCS+**: Hash-based backup signature scheme.

### Cell Security Features

Individual cells incorporate various security features:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Cells execute in isolated environments with limited access to system resources.
- **Memory Safety**: Implementation in memory-safe languages or with memory safety mechanisms.
- **Resource Quotas**: Strict limits on resource consumption by individual cells.
- **Formal Verification**: Critical cells undergo formal verification to prove security properties.
- **Secure Defaults**: Cells are configured with secure default settings.
- **Secure Update Mechanism**: Cells can be securely updated when vulnerabilities are discovered.

### Provider Security Infrastructure

Cell providers implement comprehensive security measures:

- **Supply Chain Security**: Ensures the integrity of cells throughout the development and distribution process.
- **Continuous Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scans cells for known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Testing**: Rigorous security testing before cell distribution.
- **Secure Delivery**: Ensures cells are delivered securely to assemblers.
- **Revocation Mechanism**: Quick revocation of compromised cells.
- **Transparency Reporting**: Public disclosure of security issues and mitigation measures.

## Privacy Architecture

QCC's privacy architecture centers around the Quantum Trail system, which enables personalization without identification:

### Quantum Trail Design

- **Anonymous Signatures**: Quantum trails use anonymous cryptographic signatures that cannot be traced back to individuals.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verifies properties without revealing underlying data.
- **Differential Privacy**: Adds noise to data to prevent identification of individuals.
- **Decentralized Storage**: No central repository of user data exists.

- **Time-Limited Storage**: Data expires after a defined period.

### Privacy-Preserving Personalization

- **Local Personalization**: Preference learning occurs locally when possible.
- **Federated Learning**: Improvements are learned across the system without centralizing data.
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computation on encrypted data without decryption.

By making the attack surface ephemeral and separating personalization from identification, QCC creates inherent security and privacy advantages. The comprehensive implementation of post-quantum cryptography ensures long-term security, while the zero-trust architecture provides defense in depth. The privacy-by-design approach ensures that user privacy is protected at the architectural level rather than through bolt-on solutions.

While no system can claim to be completely secure or private, QCC's architecture addresses security and privacy at the fundamental design level, creating a solid foundation that can evolve to address emerging threats while maintaining strong user protections.
